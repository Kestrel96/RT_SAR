# SAR Data organization
# Range and Azimuth Compression
## Range compression
- Mainly based on pulse compression in range direction
## Azimuth compression
- Mainly based on phase change that occurs during flyby. The target in slant (the real distance to the target) gets closer, reaches closest point (zero Doppler) and exits the aperture with rising slant range. This movement creates chirp due to phase changes.
